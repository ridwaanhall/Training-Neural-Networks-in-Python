I found that SDRNN stands for **State-Denoised Recurrent Neural Networks**. It is a type of neural network architecture that performs multiple steps of internal processing for each external sequence step. On a range of tasks, it has been shown to outperform a generic RNN as well as a variant of the SDRNN with attractor dynamics on the hidden state but without the auxillary loss ¹. It has been used in the adaptive control of nonlinear dynamical systems and has been shown to be more efficient and accurate than DRNN ².
